faoAfricaData: Using agriculture data of given countries, R scripts can approximate yield numbers for multiple African regions. 
ABOUT
The faoAfricaData project calculates the yield outputs of countries on the sub-national level. All data was extracted from “CountryStat.org”, which is the country-specific version of FAOSTAT. 
The inputs data used to calculate the yield values were Area Harvested and Production data which were extracted from the Sub-National Data Base. Location example for Gambia: http://countrystat.org/home.aspx?c=GHA&tr=21. 
The agriculture units for the Yield values, as noted in National Core http://countrystat.org/home.aspx?c=GHA&tr=1, are “Production quantity of Primary Crops (tonnes)” divided by “Area Harvested (ha)”. Thus, yield units are (tonnes/ha).

HOW TO USE
The scripts were written in the R statistical programming language. These packages may need to be installed within R: 
> install.packages("reshape2")
> install.packages("stringr")
> install.packages("plyr")


The input data necessary for the yields to be calculated is inside of the pSIMS_FAO_Data (Shared Dropbox Folder_ http://goo.gl/dBMP0x). All Production and Area Harvested files inside the “pSIMS_FAO_Data/yield inputs” are in CSV and are in yield format (YF). YF is just a clean file version of the extracted data from the website. Some files may have been TRANSLATED. In these cases, they were translated either from Portuguese to English or French to English. (Google- Translate a document was utilized in all cases). 
~Before running the scripts, change the directory to the location of the “pSIMS_FAO_Data” folder. The outputs should be identical to current yield files.

The years of data, variation of crops, and the availability of both area and production varied. Final countries with outputs include: Angola, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, and Togo. In the case that any yield outputs seem suspicious, the source of the data itself would be speculative.
